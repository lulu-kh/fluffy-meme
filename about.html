<h1>Our Story</h1>

<p>
Harrison Jones, founder of HMJ Contracts, has 7 years of electrical engineering experience, with an eye for all things technical and a partiuclar eye for detail. 

Harrison began a personal home renovation project in 2019, and has been documenting his progress on instagram, which has built up a substantial following and led to a number of renovation jobs in and around the Colchester area (see testimonials).

In the year 2020, Following the COVID-19 crisis, Harrison was made redundant from his full-time position as an electrical engineer and chose this time to purse what he has a real passion for - house renovation - and decided to set up HMJ Contracts. 

HMJ Contacts pride themselves in providing an excellent service and superior quality. The customer is always key and HMJ Contracts always works hard to maintain a good working relationship throughout the whole project.
