<p>
        We offer Commercial and residential maintenance services & facility management. We work closely with a number of estate agents providing preventative and reactive maintenance. 

        We offer both small and large scale refurbishment works. Managing everything from planning applications to the completions of the project. 
        
       We particularly specialise in garden buildings, having successfully completed several garden buildings, we appreciate the added value this can add both financially and physically to a household. As a relatively cost effective way to add more space to your home for whatever you may need it for, whether it be an outside office, garden room or even a space for a hot tub!
        
        We only use the best materials both for the a superior aesthetic finish, but also to ensure our work starts the test of time.
