        Harrison at HMJ Contracts Ltd has carried out a number of jobs for me. The works completed were of a very high standard.  Harrison is reliable, polite and courteous and his work is always neat and tidy.  I will be using him for my next project which involves changing/updating the main house fuse box.  Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend.  (( Donna))

<p>Harrison has carried out extensive work at our dance studio over the two years, his attention to detail throughout is first class. 

        Internal and external works included a full dance studio refurb giving us a gorgeous make-over, including made to measure reception area, woodwork, internal and external electrics and tiling. Harrison advised on all improvements to the design to help make best use of the space and we love it. 
        
        Harrison is now my go-to for any building work, not only at the studio but at home. Great communication, reliable and professional. ((Colchester Dance HQ))</p>

       <div> <p>We have recently used HMJ Contracts for two rental properties we purchased and needed refurbishing urgently due to time constraints. Harrison and Francesca attended the properties and quoted us within the same week, and by the next week Harrison had started on the first house. Harrison is very knowledgeable, and was able to advise us & complete the works to meet the current regulations for electrics regarding rental properties.  A huge thank you to Harrison and his team - We will definitely be using HMJ Contracts in the near future! ((Annon))</p>
